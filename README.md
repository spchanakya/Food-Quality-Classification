# Food-Quality-Classification
This is a readme reference file for the peer review code:

## The code is a part of the total project. The total Project has two parts

part 1: Fruit classification: Detecting the fruit in the image.

Part 2: Quality Classification: Detecting the Quality of the Fruit

The Peer review code consists of Part 1 of the project, where we classify fruits (Banana, Mango).
## About the code
The Code performs the classification of Banana and Mango, and the results Plot the Accuracy and Loss curves for the validation Data and Test data.
## About the Data
The Dataset used for this project had been rearranged per requirements and extracted from public Datasets from Kaggle and a few open-source resources. The Links for the Datasets are Mentioned below

Link 1: https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/y3649cmgg6/3

Link 2: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sriramr/fruits-fresh-and-rotten-for-classification

The Dataset for the Peer review has been reduced due to computational easiness. It has been rearranged into 2 Labels (Banana, Mango).each class has approximately equal proportions of Ripe, Raw, and Rotton quality images. each image is 224 x 224 RGB images.

The Training Data has 260 images of Banana and 233 photos of Mango. The Test Data has  115 bananas and 72 images of Mango.
