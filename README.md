I would recommend executing this code for a small sample of code (tstresize.jpeg) and we will get the output label .

In this code, we will import the final_Model, which is the best model is VGG16 pre-trained with fine-tuning, which has 88% accuracy .and the test input is tstresize.jpeg, and we will get the output of the code as the predicted label.
